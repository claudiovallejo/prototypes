  "contact": "Hello, above are several prototypes I'll be showing my client sometime next week (Oct 3+). I made these prototypes for two reasons. 1) So my client could interact with several designs to better evaluate the prototypes. 2) I want to learn more about web design and development. This is the first time I use <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"http://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyions</a> (and it's ‚ú® magical ‚ú®) and its also the first time I share my design and development process (you can find some shots <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop/status/781175709821575168\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). I'm barely starting out as a designer / developer, and want to improve as much as I can. So please, if you have any comments or feedback, let me know <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop\" target=\"_blank\">@claudiovallejop</a>.",
