  "contact": "Above are several prototypes I'll be showing my client sometime next week (Oct 3+). I made these prototypes for several reasons... 1) So my client could interact with the proposed portfolio designs. 2) Dive into <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"http://tachyons.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Tachyons</a> (it's magical btw). And 3) share my design and development process (you can find some shots <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop/status/781175709821575168\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>). If you have any comments or feedback, let me know <a class=\"light-purple link\" href=\"https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop\" target=\"_blank\">@claudiovallejop</a>.",
