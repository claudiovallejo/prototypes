# Filipao Nunes — Portfolio

I'll be sharing my prototyping process as I continue to design Filipao Nunes's [portfolio](http://filipaonunes.com). I want to share my process because I'd love to hear feedback on how I can improve my design and development skills as well as my design and development process. Let me know what you think [@claudiovallejop](https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop).

For this project I'll be using Vim for the first time and will also be working with Tachyons for the first time. I decided to use HTML/CSS instead of using other prototyping tools because I want to work on my front-end skills and I also want my client to interact with real websites for next week's meeting.

### Tools —
