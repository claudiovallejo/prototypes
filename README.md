# Filipao Nunes — Portfolio

I'll be sharing my prototyping process as I continue to design Filipao Nunes's (portfolio)[http://filipaonunes.com]. I want to share my process because I'd love to hear feedback on how I can improve my design and development skills as well as my design and development process. I decided to prototype with HTML and CSS because I want to improve my front-end skills and also because I wanted to dive into Tachyons and start learning vim.
