# Filipao Nunes — Portfolio

I'll be sharing my prototyping process as I continue to design Filipao Nunes's [portfolio](http://filipaonunes.com). If you have any feedback or comments about my code, design or process let me know [@claudiovallejop](https://twitter.com/claudiovallejop).

For this project I'll be using Vim for the first time and will also be working with Tachyons for the first time. I decided to use HTML/CSS instead of using other prototyping tools because I want to work on my front-end skills and I also want my client to interact with real websites for next week's meeting.

### Tools —
+ [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com)
+ [Tachyons](http://tachyons.io)
+ [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com)
